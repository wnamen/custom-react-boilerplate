# Custom React Boilerplate
For those who are looking for something without the training wheels of "create-react-app". This is a custom boilerplate I built from scratch with custom designs and css already loaded. Enjoy!

### Minimum Requirements

1. NPM @ 3.10.3
2. Node @ v6.5.0
3. Webpack installed globally

### Development Instructions

1. Run "npm install" to install dependencies
2. Run "nodemon" to start the server
3. In another window, run "webpack --watch" to bundle the app. Upon any changes in the code, webpack will automatically rebundle. Just refresh the page!
